Senior software engineer, with 15 years of programming experience, 7 professional. Was the lead developer of Hadean's spatial and simulation technology, Simulate. Currently designing profiling tools for high performance and large scale systems. Passionate about high performance / low latency / datacenter scale computing. Expertise in C++, Python, Linux, eBPF, profiling/optimisation, and GPU programming for graphics and compute. Joining a startup from the very early stages meant taking on a wide range of responsibilities beyond software development, including team leading, management, public speaking, technical writing, interviewing and hiring, evangelising best practices.

Key areas of interest are:

- Writing high performance software in C++ and Python for CPUs and GPUs
- Developing novel profling tools for high performance / low latency / datacenter scale computing
- Spatial data structures and algorithms
- Accelerators including clusters, CPU SIMD, GPGPU, and FPGA programming

CEO, Hadean: "I've never seen someone come into a company and have as big an impact as that"

VP Eng, Hadean: "She gets s*** done"

<b>## Hadean, September 2017 - Present</b>

Hadean was a small 10 person startup when I joined. After quickly getting up to speed on the HadeanOS technology they were building, within two weeks I started developing a massively parallel spatial simulation engine for Gaming, Simulation and Science (Aether / Simulate).

Over 5 years (so far) later, Hadean is hugely successful with customers and partners in multiple markets including Epic and Microsoft, using Aether and other products. I helped grow the team, interviewing and onboarding new engineers, helped make the software production ready, massively scaled the performance, and developed various profiling tools and methods.

I developed great communication skills, writing technical and accessible blog posts for our company blog, training and onboarding within the company, external communication in a pre-sales role with partners and investors, collaborating with many disciplines (Technical Pre-Sales, Game Developers, Physicists, Biologists, Engineers, and many Software Engineers).

<b>## Createc, July 2016, September 2016 - September 2017</b>

Spatial data processing, sensor fusion, real-time embedded systems, machine learning image classification (CNN, Tensorflow, Caffe) on multi-GPU system, embedded computer vision SLAM.

<b>## University of Cambridge, Computer Science, October 2013 - June 2016</b>

Graduated with a 2:1 in Computer Science (including courses in Maths and Physics). Among my favourite courses were Machine Learning, Advanced Rendering, Bioinformatics, Comparative (System) Architectures, Computer Vision. My final year project was an advanced real-time ray-tracing pipeline for desktop GPUs, which was written in C, OpenGL and GLSL and which showed a performance increase of 25x over the benchmark version of the renderer.

<b>## Side Projects</b>

- Various C++ open source libraries and utilities
- A compiler for a new programming language for writing parallel code on a variety of accelerators (multicore CPUs, SIMD coprocessors and GPUs)
    LLVM, GLSL, Lex/Flex, Yacc/Bison, C++

- A network visualiser for processes distributed across machines
    Javascript, D3.js, iproute2 SS

- A combined sampling and tracing profiler
    Python, eBPF, DWARF debug info

- An experimental (tiny) soft 8 bit processor core on an FPGA
    Verilog, FPGAs

- A boot loader in x86 assembly
    x86 Assembly

- A dynamic website backed by a database
    Go, Javascript, HTML, CSS
