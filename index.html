Senior software engineer, with 15 years of programming experience, 7 professional. Lead developer of Hadean's spatial and simulation technology, Simulate. Currently designing next generation eBPF-based profiling tools for high performance large scale systems. Passionate about high performance / low latency / datacenter scale computing. Expertise in C++, Python, Linux, eBPF, profiling/optimisation, and GPU programming for graphics and compute. Current role involves a wide range of responsibilities beyond software development, including team leading, management, public speaking, technical writing, interviewing and hiring, evangelising best practices.

Key areas of interest are:
- Writing high performance software in C++ and Python for CPUs and GPUs
- Developing novel profling tools for high performance / low latency / datacenter scale computing
- Spatial data structures and algorithms
- Accelerators including clusters, CPU SIMD, GPGPU, and FPGA programming

CEO, Hadean: "I've never seen someone come into a company and have as big an impact as that"

VP Eng, Hadean: "She gets s*** done"

<b>## Hadean, September 2017 - Present</b>

Within two weeks of joining this small 10 person startup, I was up to speed and developing a massively parallel spatial simulation engine for Gaming, Simulation and Science (Aether / Simulate).

Over 5 years later, Hadean is hugely successful with customers and partners in multiple markets including Epic and Microsoft, selling Aether and other products. Hadean is now over 100 people. I was instrumental in interviewing and onboarding new colleagues. I helped make the software production ready, massively scaled the performance, and developed various profiling tools and methods.

I developed great communication skills, writing technical and accessible blog posts for our company blog, mediating technical decisions and building consensus, training and onboarding within the company, external communication in a pre-sales role with partners and investors, collaborating with many disciplines (Technical Pre-Sales, Game Developers, Physicists, Biologists, Engineers, and many Software Engineers).

I'm usually the person called in to either save projects, or make them successful from the start (tech review / architecture).

<b>## Createc, July 2016, September 2016 - September 2017</b>

Spatial data processing, sensor fusion, real-time embedded systems, machine learning image classification (CNN, Tensorflow, Caffe) on multi-GPU system, embedded computer vision SLAM.

<b>## University of Cambridge, 2:1 Computer Science, October 2013 - June 2016</b>

- Studied courses in Maths, Physics, Machine Learning, Advanced Rendering, Bioinformatics, Comparative (System) Architectures, Computer Vision
- Increased performance 25x over the reference implementation of an advanced real-time ray-tracing pipeline for desktop GPUs (C, OpenGL, and GLSL) for my final year project. Optimised the performance with a carefully chosen binary space partitioning tree, like an octree but 64-ary nodes, a stack of parent nodes, and a trick to quickly find the common ancestor node.

<b>## Side Projects</b>

- Various C++ open source libraries and utilities
- Compiler for a new programming language for writing parallel code on a variety of accelerators (multicore CPUs, SIMD coprocessors and GPUs)
    LLVM, GLSL, Lex/Flex, Yacc/Bison, C++

- Network visualiser for processes distributed across machines
    Javascript, D3.js, iproute2 SS

- Combined sampling and tracing profiler
    Python, eBPF, DWARF debug info

- 8 bit processor core on an FPGA
    Verilog, FPGAs

- Boot loader in x86 assembly
    x86 Assembly

- Dynamic website with a database backend
    Go, Javascript, HTML, CSS
