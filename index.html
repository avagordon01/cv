Programmer for over ten years, currently a professional software developer and research engineer at Hadean.
I am the lead developer of Hadean's distributed spatial simulation engine, Aether, and our spatial technology.
Working at a startup from the very early stages I have taken on a wide range of responsibilities, including growing our engine development team, researching and designing the spatial technology, and developing it using agile methods.

<h2>Employment</h2>
<h4>Hadean September 2018 - Present</h4>
<ul>
    <li>
        Hadean was a small startup when I joined, looking for market fit in three verticals.
        After quickly getting up to speed on the HadeanOS technology they were building, within two weeks I started developing Aether for Gaming, Simulation and Science.
        We quickly found traction in gaming after going to GDC with a small demo, using Aether as an MMO backend.
        We accelerated development and I helped grow the team, hiring and onboarding new engineers.
        I grew a huge amount by being the lead developer, getting the chance to work closely with all different business functions.
    </li>
</ul>
<h4>Createc July 2016, September 2016 - September 2017</h4>
<ul>
    <li>
        I joined Createc in summer 2016 for an internship and, due to my excellent work and attitude, within three days was offered a permanent post.
        I gained valuable experience working with ROS and real-time and embedded systems on drones with many sensors including radiation sensors.
        These systems are currently in use in extremely challenging environments at Fukushima (Japan) and Sellafield (UK).
        I developed a deep-learning system, to classify X-Ray images of baggage as threat or benign, using Caffe on a multi GPU system, for deployment on an embedded system.
        I used computer vision algorithms on a lightweight, embedded, aerial platform.
        I worked on a scanner system for industrial purposes, to accurately map, and present potentially hazardous environments remotely.
        One of my favourite parts of working for Createc was the mentoring, for example teaching debugging a device driver.
        My proudest achievement while working there was developing a system to ingest point cloud data from many sensors, fuse it into a single cloud, store the tens of millions of points efficiently, pass it through processing steps, and then display it to a user interactively, based on the hardware position sensor data.
        This system is in use on multiple different projects that are central to the company.
    </li>
</ul>
<h4>University of Cambridge, Computer Science October 2013 - June 2016</h4>
<ul>
    <li>
        Due to my outstanding A-level results and passion, I had the opportunity to study at Cambridge, attaining a 2:1.
        Among my favourite courses were Machine Learning, Advanced Rendering, Bioinformatics, Comparative Architectures, Computer Vision, and Information Retrieval, I found these particularly rewarding because they focused on understanding large, complex, real-world subjects.
        In the second year, I worked with a team (contributing a large part of the code, experience and bugfixes) to develop a game system for an external company, Frontier.
        The client feedback was that the product and teamwork was excellent.
        My final year project was on an advanced voxel ray-tracing pipeline for desktop GPUs, which was written in C, OpenGL and GLSL and which showed a performance increase of 25x over the benchmark version of the renderer.
    </li>
</ul>
<h4>Citrix August 2012</h4>
<ul>
    <li>
        In August 2012, I worked in the XenClient team of Citrix, a multinational virtualisation software provider.
        At Citrix, I was asked to write an automated test suite for network connectivity, for an interface I had never seen, in a language I had never used before (Python).
        I swiftly learned the fundamentals of the interface and language.
        After completing the test suite, my work went into production while I was there.
        Unbeknown to me, my supervisor had bet his colleagues that I would not be able to complete this task in the time set.
        I confounded his expectations by learning the new language and completing the whole task in less than two weeks.

<h2>Interests</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p><em>National Cipher Challenge</em> Whilst still at school I reached the final round for the last three years and won two awards.
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><em>Robotics Engineering and Space Science</em> I participated in a two week Imperial College Summer School when I was 11.
        This was led by Dr Richard Palfrey, who said <q>Patrick... was able to articulate his ideas extremely well.
        Patrick's final presentation (on robotics) was excellent.</q></p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><em>UK Mathematical Challenge</em> Run by Leeds University.
        Starting with the regional final, I achieved a Gold Award and four Silver awards.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>I am keen on Bouldering, Badminton and Cycling, being part of the Selwyn 2nd team for Badminton for 2 years.</p>
